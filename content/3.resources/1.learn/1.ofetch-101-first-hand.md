[ofetch](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch) is a utility package to make HTTP requests. It exists to unify the API between Node.js, browser and workers and is built on top of the [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

In fact, Node.js [fully supports the fetch API since version 18](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API#browser_compatibility) via the [unidici project](https://github.com/nodejs/undici). If we want to support older versions, we will need to use a third-party package.

At the same time, we want to be able to fetch in every environment with the same code. Code could start running in a worker and then in a browser.

[ofetch](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch) has been created to simplify these tasks and provide a wrapper around the native fetch API with more options and features.

## Installation

First, let's create a new project:

```bash
mkdir ofetch-101
cd ofetch-101
npm init -y
```

Then, install the package:

```bash
npm install ofetch
```

::alert{type="info"}
We can use the package manager of our choice like `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm` or `bun`.
::

## First request

In order to make our first request, let's create a file named `first-request.mjs` with the following content:

```js [first-request.mjs]
import { ofetch } from 'ofetch'

const data = await ofetch('https://ungh.cc/repos/unjs/ofetch')
```

Then, we can run the script with:

```bash
node first-request.mjs
```

And _voilÃ _, we should see something like this:

```sh
{
  repo: {
    id: 319960543,
    name: 'ofetch',
    repo: 'unjs/ofetch',
    description: 'ðŸ˜± A better fetch API. Works on node, browser and workers.',
    createdAt: '2020-12-09T13:11:38Z',
    updatedAt: '2023-09-04T17:23:36Z',
    pushedAt: '2023-09-04T21:05:19Z',
    stars: 2474,
    watchers: 14,
    forks: 80,
    defaultBranch: 'main'
  }
}
```

We have made our first request with [ofetch](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch)! :tada: Easy, right?

### Manual parsing

In our first example, the returned result is automatically parsed to JSON thanks to [unjs/destr](https://github.com/unjs/destr).

<!-- TODO: add related article to 101 destr -->

This behavior is very useful but sometimes, we want to manually parse the result.

The first way to change how received data is parsed is using the `responseType` option. [ofetch](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch) provides several options:

- `text` to have the raw text
- `json` to have a JSON object
- `blob` to have a `Blob` object
- `arrayBuffer` to have an `ArrayBuffer` object
- `stream` to have a `ReadableStream` object

To try it, let's create a new file named `manual-parsing.mjs`.

```js [manual-parsing.mjs]
import { ofetch } from 'ofetch'

const data = await ofetch('https://ungh.cc/repos/unjs/ofetch', {
  responseType: 'blob',
})

console.log(data) // A Blob object is returned.
```

We can also provide a custom function to parse the result using the `parseFunction` option. By default, [ofetch](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch) uses [unjs/destr](https://github.com/unjs/destr). Let's make our custom parser by creating a new file named `custom-parsing.mjs`.

```js [custom-parsing.mjs]
import { ofetch } from 'ofetch'

const data = await ofetch('https://ungh.cc/repos/unjs/ofetch', {
  parseFunction: (data) => {
    return data // We return the raw data but we could use JSON.parse to return a JSON object.
  },
})

console.log(data) // The data is not parsed.
```

The function takes the raw data as an argument and must return something, ideally, data parsed.

## Type safety

::alert{type="info"}
Usage of TypeScript is not mandatory to use [ofetch](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch).
::

Thanks to TypeScript and generics, [ofetch](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch) can be type safe. In order to easily use TypeScript to run our scripts, we will use [unjs/jiti](https://github.com/unjs/jiti).

<!-- TODO: add related article to 101 jiti -->

We can use it using `npx`:

```bash
npx jiti <filename>.ts
```

Now that we are ready, let's create another file called `type-safety.ts` to type safe our [ofetch](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch) request:

```bash
touch type-safety.ts
```

Then, let's create an interface for the response. We will use the same request as in our first request.

```ts [type-safety.ts]
interface Repo {
  id: number
  name: string
  repo: string
  description: string
  stars: number
}
```

Now, we can use the [ofetch](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch) function, like in our `first-request.ts` file, but this time, we will add a generic type to it.

```ts [type-safety.ts]
import { ofetch } from 'ofetch'

interface Repo {
  id: number
  name: string
  repo: string
  description: string
  stars: number
}

async function main() {
  const { repo } = await ofetch<{ repo: Repo }>('https://ungh.cc/api/github/unjs/ofetch')

  console.log(`The repo ${repo.name} has ${repo.stars} stars.`) // The repo object is now strongly typed.
}

main().catch(console.error)
```

Nothing more to have a fully typed repo object! :ok_hand:

::alert{type="warning"}
This is **not a validation**. It's just a way to tell TypeScript what the response should look like. If we want full validation, we can use a tool like [zod](https://zod.dev) or [valibot](https://valibot.dev).

## Options

With [ofetch](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch), we can do much more than simple `GET` requests. Let's see how to use and combine options to make more complex requests.

### Methods

[ofetch](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch) supports all the HTTP methods. Let's see how to use one of them. To test a `POST` request, we will use the GitHub API. Let's create a new file named `methods.mjs` with the following content:

```js [methods.mjs]
import { ofetch } from 'ofetch'

const response = await ofetch('https://api.github.com/gists', {
  method: 'POST',
}) // Be careful, we use the GitHub API.

console.log(response)
```

Of course, we receive an `401 Unauthorized` error because we didn't provide any authentication. But this error means we have successfully made a `POST` request.

Supported methods are:

- `GET`
- `POST`
- `PUT`
- `PATCH`
- `DELETE`
- `HEAD`
- `OPTIONS`

### Body

Of course, when the method is not `GET` or `HEAD`, we can provide a body to the request. Let's see how to do it by creating a new file named `body.mjs` with the following content:

```js [body.mjs]
import { ofetch } from 'ofetch'

const response = await ofetch('https://api.github.com/markdown', {
  method: 'POST',
  // To provide a body, we need to use the `body` option and just use an object.
  body: {
    text: 'UnJS is **awesome**!\n\nCheck out their [website](https://unjs.io).',
  },
}) // Be careful, we use the GitHub API.

console.log(response)
```

And we receive:

```html
<p>UnJS is <strong>awesome</strong>!</p>
<p>Check out their <a href="https://unjs.io" rel="nofollow">website</a>.</p>
```

Perfect and easy!

The body can take several formats:

- `string`
- `FormData`
- `URLSearchParams`
- `Blob`
- `BufferSource`
- `ReadableStream`
- `Record<string, any>`

### Query string

We can also provide some query string parameters to the request. They can be useful to add filters or to paginate the results.

Imagine we want to get the last 2 tags of the [`unjs/ofetch`](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch) repository. We can do it by creating a new file named `query-string.mjs` with the following content:

```js [query-string.mjs]
import { ofetch } from 'ofetch'

const response = await ofetch('https://api.github.com/repos/unjs/ofetch/tags', {
  query: {
    per_page: 2,
  },
}) // Be careful, we use the GitHub API directly.

console.log(response)
```

We receive this response (results could be different, because the tags are updated):

```js
[
  {
    name: 'v1.3.3',
    zipball_url: 'https://api.github.com/repos/unjs/ofetch/zipball/refs/tags/v1.3.3',
    tarball_url: 'https://api.github.com/repos/unjs/ofetch/tarball/refs/tags/v1.3.3',
    commit: {
      sha: '051ef83ceba6cc496ac487969c9f6611ef6bd10d',
      url: 'https://api.github.com/repos/unjs/ofetch/commits/051ef83ceba6cc496ac487969c9f6611ef6bd10d'
    },
    node_id: 'MDM6UmVmMzE5OTYwNTQzOnJlZnMvdGFncy92MS4zLjM='
  },
  {
    name: 'v1.3.2',
    zipball_url: 'https://api.github.com/repos/unjs/ofetch/zipball/refs/tags/v1.3.2',
    tarball_url: 'https://api.github.com/repos/unjs/ofetch/tarball/refs/tags/v1.3.2',
    commit: {
      sha: '1258d51494656c9507a8bb82646c644c64f23e69',
      url: 'https://api.github.com/repos/unjs/ofetch/commits/1258d51494656c9507a8bb82646c644c64f23e69'
    },
    node_id: 'MDM6UmVmMzE5OTYwNTQzOnJlZnMvdGFncy92MS4zLjI='
  }
]
```

A query string is an object of type `{ [key: string]: any }` so it's easy to use.

::alert{type="info"}
We can find a key `params` in the options. It's an alias for `query`.
::

### Headers

In the [methods section](#methods), we encountered an error because we didn't provide any authentication. With headers, we can solve our problem. In fact, we need to provide to GitHub an authentication token in a header named `Authorization` with a value of `token <token>`. Let's see how to do it by creating a new file named `headers.mjs` with the following content:

```js [headers.mjs]
import { ofetch } from 'ofetch'

const response = await ofetch('https://api.github.com/gists', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    Authorization: `token ${process.env.GH_TOKEN}`,
  }
}) // Be careful, we use the GitHub API directly.

console.log(response)
```

::alert{type="info"}
We can generate a new GitHub Token with the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com): `gh auth token`.
::

We can run the script with:

```bash
GH_TOKEN=<token> node headers.mjs
```

And we get the following error:

```bash
FetchError: [POST] "https://api.github.com/gists": 422 Unprocessable Entity
```

And that's a good thing! It means we have successfully authenticated to GitHub. We just need to provide a valid body to the request but now, we know how to do it! We have to add the `body` option to the request with correct data:

```js [headers.mjs]
import { ofetch } from 'ofetch'

const response = await ofetch('https://api.github.com/gists', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    Authorization: `token ${process.env.GH_TOKEN}`,
  },
  body: {
    description: 'This is a gist created by ofetch.',
    public: true,
    files: {
      'unjs.txt': {
        content: 'UnJS is awesome!',
      }
    }
  }
}) // Be careful, we use the GitHub API directly.

console.log(response.url)
```

Run the script again:

```bash
GH_TOKEN=<token> node headers.mjs
```

And as a result, we get the URL of the created gist! :raised_hands:

::alert{type="danger"}
Never put credential token directly in code. Use an environment variable instead.
::

### Error handling

This part is straightforward with [ofetch](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch). Surround the HTTP call with a `try/catch` block and we're done. Let's see how to do it by creating a new file named `error-handling.ts` with the following content:

```js [error-handling.mjs]
import { ofetch } from 'ofetch'

try {
  await ofetch('https://api.github.com', {
    method: 'POST',
  })
}
catch (error) {
  // Error will be pretty printed
  console.error(error)
}
```

With that, we will only see a `FetchError` in the console. We can do better. In fact, we can retrieve the returned error body using `error.data`. Let's update our script a little:

```js [error-handling.mjs]
// ...

try {
  // ...
}
catch (error) {
  console.log(error.data) // This allows us to get the error body.
}
```

Then, run the script and we get the following error that we can easily use to display a message to the user:

```sh
{
  message: 'Not Found',
  documentation_url: 'https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos#create-a-repository-for-the-authenticated-user'
}
```

We can also completely disable error response using the option `ignoreResponseError`.

## Conclusion

We have seen how to use [ofetch](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch) to easily make HTTP requests in any environment. We have seen how to use the different options to make more complex requests and how to gracefully handle errors.

With this 101, we've just scratched the surface of [ofetch](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch). In the next articles, we will use some advanced options like `retry` and `timeout` to make our requests more robust, interceptors to make optimistic updates, and how to create a fetch with some default options!
